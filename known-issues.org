* ece-install
** 2013-01-17 cron script removes all 15 day old files on the system
- *Fixed in Version* :: 1.0-2013-01-17-468

- *Versions affected* :: 1.0-2013-01-12-x => 1.0-2013-01-17-x

If you have installed and run either the =ece-install= all-in-one,
presentation or editorial profile between *2013-01-12*
and *2013-01-17*, you have encountered this issue.

If you have =escenic-content-engine-installer= of any of the versions
affected, first remove the cron job if it's present:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# rm /etc/cron.daily/remove-old-escenic-cache-files
#+END_SRC

Then upgrade to the latest version of =ece-install= so that you're
sure new runs of it will set up a proper cron job.  If you're using
our APT repository at apt.escenic.com, this as easy as:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# apt-get update
# apt-get install escenic-content-engine-scripts
#+END_SRC
