** Changing the DB Virtual IP

In your habitat, DB clients, such as the ECEs, use the database using
the <%= trail_db_vip_host %> virtual IP (VIP). Whenever you change the master,
as described in [[Changing the Master DB]], you must also change the VIP
that the clients of the DB use.

We have deliberately _not_ set this up as an automatic failover using
[[http://linux-ha.org][Heartbeat]] as we want DB failover to be a conscious matter.

*** Take down the existing VIP
If <%= trail_db_master_host %> is still up, log on to it and take down its
VIP:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh root@<%= trail_db_master_host %>
# ifconfig <%= trail_db_vip_interface %> down
#+END_SRC

*** Set up the VIP interface on <%= trail_db_slave_host %>
You're now ready to set up the VIP on <%= trail_db_slave_host %>. You may want
to ensure that there's no one acclaiming the IP, do:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ping <%= trail_db_vip_host %>
#+END_SRC

If no one answers, you can go ahead and set it up:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh root@<%= trail_db_slave_host %>
# ifconfig eth0:0 <%= trail_db_vip_ip %> up
#+END_SRC

Pinging <%= trail_db_vip_host %> should now yield <%= trail_db_vip_ip %> again,
and the answer should come frmo <%= trail_db_slave_host %>:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ping <%= trail_db_vip_host %>
PING <%= trail_db_vip_host %> (<%= trail_db_vip_ip %>) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from <%= trail_db_vip_ip %>: icmp_req=1 ttl=249 time=1.18 ms
#+END_SRC
