* Amazon Instance
(Ignore this chapter for if you have KVM implementation)

This chapter tells you about dealing with amazon instances in your installation.

** Resize disk (EBS Volume) in an Amazon instance

To resize an EBS Volume using the AWS GUI console

1. Shut down the machine/instance.
2. Detach it from the instance, while detaching NOTE DOWN the exact device name where the volume had been attached 
3. Take a snapshot of the EBS Volume
4. Go to your snapshots listing and detect your newly created snapshot and create a new volume of your desired size from the snapshot 
5. You have now successfully re-sized your volume.
6. Now attach it to your instances, while attaching use the exact device name you noted while detaching, this is important while you are resizing the root device
7. Start the machine and associate elastic ip (if it had one before)
8. You will still see you volume with the previous size. You have to run resize2fs on the device to get the new size effective
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
      # resize2fs /dev/xvda1
     #+END_SRC


** Add a new EBS volume in a Amazon machine instance:

From Amazon EC2 Management Console
1. Create the volume of desired size
2. Attach the volume as device with the desired instance (same zone as the volume)

From the ec2 instance
1. ssh into it as root
2. format the device
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
      # mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
     #+END_SRC
3. Put the mount entry in /etc/fstab
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
      /dev/xvdf  /var/exports auto    defaults,nobootwait,comment=cloudconfig 0 2
     #+END_SRC
4. Then mount it
     #+BEGIN_SRC text
      # mount -a
     #+END_SRC
