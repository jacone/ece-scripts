* Operating System Maintenance

Before proceeding, please note that this is serious stuff. To update
the OS packages, you should feel comfortable resolving typical RPM or
DEB conflicts and set aside enough time to deal with any package
breakage which might occur. 

All servers, both the Ubuntu and RedHat ones, are running stable
branches of their OS, so normally, there will be no breakage, and
upgrades should be safe to be carried out on a regular (bi-weekly for
instance) basis. However, you should always be fully alert when making
these updates and be sure to have enough time on your hands to resolve
any issues before going ahead with the upgrades below.

** Debian based operating systems
This applies to OSs like Debian, Ubuntu and Mint.

In the example below, we update the Ubuntu servers called
<%= trail_presentation_host%> <%= trail_editor_host %> <%= trail_import_host %>
<%= trail_monitoring_host %> <%= trail_analysis_host %> from the comfort of
<%= trail_control_host %>.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ for el in \
   <%= trail_presentation_host %> \
   <%= trail_editor_host %> \
   <%= trail_import_host %> \
   <%= trail_monitoring_host %> \
   <%= trail_analysis_host %> \
  ; do \
      echo "Now upgrading $el"; \
      sudo ssh root@$el 'apt-get -qq update && apt-get -q upgrade' ; \
  done
#+END_SRC


** RedHat based operating systems
This applies to OSs like CentOS, RedHat and Fedora:

In the example below, we update the RedHat servers called
<%= trail_presentation_host%> <%= trail_editor_host %> <%= trail_import_host %>
<%= trail_monitoring_host %> <%= trail_analysis_host %> from the comfort of
<%= trail_control_host %>:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ for el in \
   <%= trail_presentation_host %> \
   <%= trail_editor_host %> \
   <%= trail_import_host %> \
   <%= trail_monitoring_host %> \
   <%= trail_analysis_host %> \
  ; do \
      echo "Now upgrading $el";
      ssh $el yum update; 
  done
#+END_SRC
