* Network File System

** NFS server
<%= trail_nfs_master_host %>  has these network file shares: 
~<%= trail_nfs_export_list %>~ These file share(s) are made available using
NFS.

** NFS clients
All of the hosts running an presentation or publication server will
have these shares mounted. The most important one is the one holding
the multimedia archive of Escenic Content Engine. Typically, this
share is called ~multimedia~. 

In your habitat, all the shares from ~<%= trail_nfs_export_list %>~ are
mounted on ~<%= trail_nfs_client_mount_point_parent %>~.
