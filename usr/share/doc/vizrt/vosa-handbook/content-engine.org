* Content Engine
We different Escenic Content Engines that are presentation servers
and the ones that are publication servers.

Architecturally, these look the same (strictly speaking, the
publication servers don't need the memory cache, but for simplicity of
uniformity, we install memcached on the publication servers too):

** Presentation Server
The presentation is an ECE which has the publication(s) templates and
typically doesn't have the Content Studio and Web Studio web
applications (~studio~ and ~escenic~ respectively).

** Publication Server
A publication is an ECE which doesn't have the publication(s)
templates and serves the Content Studio and Web Studio web
applications to the editorial staff. 

The publication server is often referred to as "the editorial server"
and sometimes "the studio server".
