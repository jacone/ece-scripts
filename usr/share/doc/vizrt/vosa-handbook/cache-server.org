* Cache server

The habitat uses Varnish caching servers. Caching servers are
sometimes referred to as reverse proxies (as opposed to normal proxies
such as Squid, which cache an office's web site traffic Squid) 

The Varnish caches are set up to do several tasks to make your web
site really fast and secure.

** Caching
This is the obvious task of any caching server and per default, the
Varnish caches will cache static content like pictures, flash, CSS and
JS for you.

** Security
The Varnish caches are set up to protect the following services in
your habitat:

|----------------+------------------------------------|
| URI            | What                               |
|----------------+------------------------------------|
| /escenic       | Web Studio                         |
| /escenic-admin | Escenic Admin                      |
| /studio        | Content Studio                     |
| /webservice    | Escenic Content Engine Web service |
| /munin         | The Munin overview                 |
|----------------+------------------------------------|

** Useful features for debugging
Varnish in your habitat will add the following HTTP headers to add you
in your debugging of the web site:

|------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X-Cache-Backend: pres2 | Which backend the cache used                                                         |
| X-Cache: HIT #68/80s   | If the requested URI's content was found in cache, and how old it has been in cache. |
