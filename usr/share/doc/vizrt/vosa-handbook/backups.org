* Backups

** Multimedia archive
The mutlimedia archive lives on <%= trail_nfs_master_host %> (with a
mirror on <%= trail_nfs_slave_host %> ) from which it exports its
shares to the various hosts on the network through an NFS interface. A
backup of the =/var/exports= directory on this server should suffice
as all NFS shares reside in this directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
<%= trail_nfs_master_host %>:/var/exports  
#+END_SRC

It's recommended that the backup isn't done using the NFS mount on one
of the other hosts using this NFS server, but instead target the
<%= trail_nfs_master_host %> =/var/exports= directory directly as the
backup tools would access any server directory.
