* SSH Access

This chapter describes how you can access the <%= trail_network_name %>
network using SSH and assumes that you have your [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#Key_management][SSH key]] on the
<%= trail_gk_host %> and all over the <%= trail_network_name %>.

It also assumes that the gateway IP of your office/network has been
added to the access control list of hosts/networks which are allowed
to access the gatekeeper.

** Generate an SSH key on Linux or Mac OS X
*** Check to see if you already have a key you can use
You only need to do this if you don't already have an SSH key. The
keys are normally stored in ~$HOME/.ssh~ so have a look here to see if
you have any:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ls ~/.ssh 
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
#+END_SRC
If you see the ~id_rsa~ and ~id_dsa.pub~, you already have one. They
can also be called something with ~dsa~ or indeed anything (the
~id_rsa[.pub]~ are just the default).

*** Generate a new SSH key
To generate a new key, you can do:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
#+END_SRC

Just hit enter when you're prompted for the name of the file. When
asked for a key password, be sure to set one. This is important, all
your SSH keys should have a password set. If not, anyone can copy your
keys and log on to all the servers where you've previously been
granted access.

If you wish to set the password on an old key, or set a new password,
you can do this by
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh-keygen -f id_rsa -p
#+END_SRC

The ~id_rsa~ above corresponds to the ~$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa~ file.

*** Add your SSH key to your key agent
On your local machine, load your SSH key into your key agent. On Linux
and Mac OS X, this should only be a matter of:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh-add  
#+END_SRC
Asking the SSH key agent for all keys should now list your key. Note
that if you have multiple keys, or have called your one key something
different that what's default, you must pass the key name to the
~ssh-add~ command above.

Once you're done adding your key(s), confirm their presence in the key
ring with:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh-add -l
2048 33:49:02:c5:30:8d:2e:9g:28:82:3a:89:5c:b3:5d:a3 /home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
#+END_SRC


** Generate an SSH key on Windows

*** Using Putty

/Generating your key:/
- Install the full Putty package including puttygen by using the Windows Installaller that is downloadable [[http://putty][here]]
- Run puttygen
- Generate your personal key (It wants you to move your mouse around a bit)
[[./graphics/puttygen1.png]]
- Give your key a name and enter a passphrase. We use keys for better security. Choosing a weak password will not help. It is called a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase][passphrase]] because your are expected to enter a sentence and not just a word.

/Storing your key:/
Make a directory like C:\Users\thv.VIZRTINT\.ssh. Do not spread your key around further. If you loose your key because your laptop crashes, you can allways create a new one. Save your key as .pkk and as .pem
- Save your key in and Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail format(.pem)
[[./graphics/puttygen3.png]]

- Save your key in a Putty Private Key File(.pkk) 
[[./graphics/puttygen4.png]]

****Using Pagent
Pagent is Putties [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent][SSH agent]]. Using am SSH agent makes the use of keys a lot easier. An SSH agent runs in the background to supply a key to any putty-ssh login you might perform during the day without retyping your passphrase.

Pagent lets you load keys interactively or on the command line.

*** Using Cygwin

Install [[http://cygwin.com][Cygwin]] and be sure to check for the =openssh-client= package
when running =setup.exe=:

[[./graphics/cygwin-openssh.png]]

Once the installation is done, you should have a =cygwin= icon to
click on:
[[http://x.cygwin.com/cygwin-icon.gif]] This will open a Unix like shell
on your Windows computer, in which you can use many of the standard
Unix commands, such as =ls=, =cd=, =cp=, =rsync= & =grep=.

In the Cygwin shell, you now run the same =ssh= command that you'd
have on Linux. This command is what you can see being used and
you can use the instructions above in the [[Generate an SSH key on Linux
or Mac OS X]] section to generate and use your SSH key.


** Log on to the gatekeeper
On your local machine, do:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh <gatekeeper host> 
#+END_SRC

** Log on to the control server
Once you're on <%= trail_gk_host %> should be able to log on to the
control server:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh <%= trail_control_host %>
#+END_SRC

From the control server, you can access any of the machines in the
<%= trail_network_name %>, e.g.:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ssh <%= trail_presentation_host %>
#+END_SRC
