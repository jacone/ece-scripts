* NAME
vosa - command to manage KVM and Amazon instances that typically form
a cluster of servers serving one or more Escenic based web sites.

* SYNOPSIS
vosa [-i instance-dir] [-v uec-version] [-V] [-d] [-h] COMMAND

* OPTIONS
** -i instance-dir
Most [[COMMANDS]] require the *-i* parameter to be set. You pass it the
path to your VM's configuration like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# vosa -i /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/vm03 enable
#+END_SRC
** -v uec-version
Let's you specify the UEC version to use
** -d
Make *vosa* more verbose. The more *-d* switches you specify, the
more verbose it gets.
** -V
Print the *vosa* version and exit
** -h
Print usage help and exit.

* COMMANDS
** enable
Enable a specific VM.
** disable
Disable a specific VM.
** install
Creates a new disk image etc.
** uninstall
Removes the disk image etc.
** start
Starts (boots) the VM.
** status
Tells you about the VM, if it's enabled, running, alive, its uptime.

* What is VOSA?

Vosa is short for Vizrt Online System Administration, a set of tools
created by Vizrt to ease various system administration chores.

It facilitates the set up and installation of virtual machines,
booting them up and installing software on them.  It also includes
steps to set up a puppet master with a generic client certificate,
and tools to install puppets that do what that puppet master says.

All of this is possible manually by apt-get'ing and configuring
manualy; the value of these scripts is that all of this is
made possible without intervention..

There are various post-installation hooks available which perform
various tasks, for simple things like creating an /etc/motd file,
to more advanced things like setting up a puppet master or
installing a production ready Escenic Content Engine using
ece-install.

** Who is it for?

It is aimed at anyone who needs to install lots of virtual machines,
and particularly at those who agree that it is valuable to be able
to completely reinstall a virtual machine from scratch without
intervention, and then put that virtual machine in production.

** Why should I use it?

The normal way of virtualizing is to sit someone in front of a
fresh VM and start to install software on it.  The software is
configured, and more software piles on until it's production ready.
Some final tweaks are made and then it might go into production.
All of this installation, configuration and tweaking is /valuable/
in the sense that doing it all over again actually costs money since
someone needs to sit down and do it.  Most of the time, the people
who did the original installation are no longer around, so doing it
all from scratch would also revert some tweaks.

A different way of looking at virtualization is to ascribe /no
value/ to the virtual machine itself, or at least to the the disk
image that constitutes the virtual machine. In order to do so, you
need to make sure that it is possible to create a fully functional
virtual machine at any time.  One that is production ready, with all
the last-minute-tweaks in place.

The Vosa scripts do just that.

A short definition file tells vosa what base image to start with;
this is an Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud image, but in theory other image
types could be supported.  The file also provides networking
parameters and so on.  Most importantly, these files also tell vosa
what to do with the virtual machine once it has booted, so-called
"post install hooks".  Each of these are executed when the "first
boot" has completed.  These hooks run only the first time the
virtual machine has booted, and should be written in such a way that
they end up with a production ready system that can go straight into
production.

** Amazon or Physical?

Vosa supports two flavours of virtualization, namely one based on
Amazon's excellent Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and one based on the
excellent Open Source Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).  Vosa aims
to blur the boundaries of these two types of virtualization, making
it possible to use the same technologies for installing software.
The possibility of using local hardware makes it possible to run a
cheap stack of virtual machines using the same method of installing
software as the production environment.  Developers can also have a
local "stack" of virtual machines, and not have to rely on AWS for
virtualization.

In the absence of EC2 metadata service that's available to real
cloud instances, the kvm flavour of virtualization allows some
additional perks, like vnc support, and it generates "throw-away"
SSH keys which are used for a single kvm instance.

** What can I do with this?

Probably the most advanced thing you could do with this is to
automate the setup of a complete data center, with database, nfs,
a virtualized server park, and various virtual machines, tomcats,
varnishes and so on, all from a single set of configuration files,
without intervention.

But you could also use it to just easily re-install a VM using the
latest and greatest Ubuntu release, instead of (as is usual) not even
daring to run apt-get upgrade.

* Installation of VOSA package

This is a terse description of what it takes to get a system to run
vosa.

** Requirements:

In order to benefit from running vosa with kvm, you need the following

- A physical machine that supports virtualization
- kvm or qemu-kvm
- genisoimage
- nc
- tunctl
- sudo access to kvm (or the more usual, which is to run vosa as root...)
- a bridged network

In theory, it should be possible to script this too, or to get e.g.
puppet to do this for us.  Watch this space!

In order to benefit from running vosa with ec2, you need the following

- Amazon account
- ec2-api-tools
- A named SSH keypair
- Signing key

** Setting up vosa on EC2

Commonly, setting up vosa in the cloud entails first making an EC2
instance that will act as "the control server".  vosa will typically
be installed there.

   : apt-get install vosa

The vosa command should now work (to a certain extent)

   : vosa help
   : vosa commands
   : vosa longhelp | less

To make vosa usable, you need to initialize it:

   : sudo vosa init

This will create the /etc/vizrt/vosa directory structure, and a
skeleton of a virtual machine definition.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sudo cp -r /etc/vizrt/vosa/skeleton-amazon \\
  /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/my-first-vosa
#+END_SRC

Configure the my-first-vosa/amazon.conf file as you see fit.  This would include:

- Generate (or re-use) an SSH private key, and uploading the public key to Amazon
- Generate (or re-use) an EC2 API signing key, and uploading the certificate to Amazon
- Create a VPC and subnet (if you want to deploy the instances to a VPC subnet)

Details on these steps are outlined in the sample amazon.conf file.

** Setting up vosa on bare metal (kvm)

Setting up vosa entails a few manual installation steps.  Among other
things it will
- provide the "vosa" command and its required libraries
- download an image of an Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud
- create 10 tap interfaces (an arbitrary number, really, see below
  for an explanation).
- create the same number of "tap*.availablenetwork" files in
  */var/run/vizrt/vosa/* each one signifying the names of the tap
  interfaces that can be used.

So without further ado, let's get started.  First of all, we need to
onstall the vosa command itself and its required libraries:

   : apt-get install vosa

The vosa command should now work (to a certain extent)

   : vosa help
   : vosa commands
   : vosa longhelp | less

To make vosa usable, you need to initialize it:

   : vosa init

This will create the /etc/vizrt/vosa directory structure, and a
skeleton of a virtual machine definition.

Let's download an Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) image to use as the
base OS.  vosa does this for you:

   : vosa -v oneiric download

** Networking

For this to be useful, your machines need to be accessible directly
on the local network.  The scripts have only been tested on a bridged
network.  So make a bridge, call it br0 or something.  How this is
done is, however outside the scope of this document.

Once you have a bridged network, you need to create tap interfaces
for each of your virtual machines.  Let's make 10 to start with.
The reason these need to be pre-allocated is that we've seen that
doing this temporarily (ca 10 seconds) makes the network go
completely dark, and so shouldn't happen whenever any virtual
machines are running.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p /var/run/vizrt/vosa
br=br0
for i in $(seq 1 10) ; do
  tap=$(tunctl -b)
  echo $br > /var/run/vizrt/vosa/$tap.availablenetwork
  brctl addif $br $tap
  ifconfig $tap up 0.0.0.0
done
#+END_SRC

If your machine has multiple network interfaces, talking with different
physical networks, you need to make several bridges, and create tap
devices for each bridge, indicating which bridge the tap interface is
bound to.  The above script uses the *br0* bridge.

This needs to happen every time you boot, so the script above should be
copied to e.g. /etc/rc.local or some other system wide boot location.

*tunctl* creates the tap interface, and we create a file with the name
of the created tap interface in a directory.  This little snippet
needs to run every time the host machine boots.

** Defining a virtual machine

Defining a virtual machine is a bit different than when using virsh
or VMware of VirtualBox.  Vosa exploits the fact that the UEC images
are pre-seeded with cloud-init, and so have a hook to execute code
during the first boot.  This means we don't need to make any changes
to the image file itself, but can boot the unmodified UEC image.

A big benefit of this is that the exact same UEC images are available
in Amazon EC2, and also in a Eucalyptus private cloud.  This means
that vosa will be able to control Amazon EC2 images in the same way.

Defining a virtual machine means creating two files (boot.conf and
install.conf) in a directory.  *vosa init* has already created a
documented skeleton which you can customize as you see fit.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/my-first-vm && \\
cp /etc/vizrt/vosa/skeleton-kvm/* \\
  /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/my-first-vm/
vi /etc/vizrt/vosa/available.d/my-first-vm/*
#+END_SRC

Note that the name you choose ("my-first-vm") must be a valid
internet host name with no domain part.  I.e. only lowercase
alphanumerics and hyphens.  The name you choose will become the
virtual machine's host name.

When you're happy with them you should of course track these in a
version control system, so you don't lose them.  Over time, these
will become more valuable than the virtual machine images themselves.

Make sure your IP and MAC addresses are unique, or make a script to
randomize them.

Now, enable your virtual machine:

   : vosa -i my-first-vm enable

This creates a symlink from available.d/my-first-vm to enabled.d, it
serves no other purpose than to differentiate between a possibly long
list of virtual machine definitions (in available.d), and the ones
you have decided to actually run on this machine.

To install the machine, just issue the "install" command:

   : vosa -i my-first-vm install

This will copy the disk image
to */var/lib/vizrt/vosa/images/my-first-vm/* and put some more files
in there (like the SSH private key), and finally it will boot up the
image and use the UEC's cloud-init support to prime the image and
execute any post-installation hooks you defined.

The host name (as the machine sees it, at least) will be the same as
the name of the virtual machine; in this case "my-first-vm"

When it's done you can SSH into the system:

   : ssh -F /var/lib/vizrt/vosa/my-first-vm/ssh.conf guest

Not that you should need to do that, of course.

* Puppet Master

Setting up a puppet master is also an important piece of vosa.

To make this possible, vosa supplies a post-install hook. This hook:

- installs the puppet master from the apt repositories,
- configures the puppet master to use hostnames instead of its DNS
  name for certificates
- configures a self signed certificate for all guests (mainly to avoid
  having to sign or auto-sign the puppets, since that is problematic
  when a machine is re-installed)
- creates vosa post-installation hook to set up a pre-authenticated
  puppet in */etc/vizrt/vosa/puppet/<puppetmaster-name>-client.sh*

This makes it possible to define more virtual machines that
automatically dance to the puppet master's tune.

Making this useful of course means pushing your puppet configuration
into the puppet master, but that's outside the scope of this
document.
