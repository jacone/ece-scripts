* NAME
ece-import - command for managing integration with and imports of
external content into the Escenic Content Engine (ECE).

* SYNOPSIS
ece-import [[[--name name]]] [[[--publication publication]]] [[[--user user]]] [[[--password password]]] COMMAND

* OPTIONS
** --name name
The name of the import job
** --publication publication
The publication name that this job belongs to.
** --user user
The HTTP user to access the download data (optional). This option only
applies when running the [[download-import-data]] command.
** --password password
The HTTP password to access the download data. This option only
applies when running the [[download-import-data]] command.

* COMMANDS
** create
ece-import will happily set up a new import job for you.
The preferred way is to use an import archive, which you typically get
from the web site developers who've created the XSL files and so
on. When you have such an import archive, you apply it like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
# ece-import --import-archive import-archive.zip create
#+END_SRC

See [[Structure of an import archive]] for a detailed specification on how
to create such an archive yourself.

Alternatively, you can set up an import job without an import archive:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
# ece-import \\
  --name myjob \\
  --publication mypub \\
  create
#+END_SRC

In both cases, *ece-import* will set up the file structure for your
import job. If you're not using an import archive you'll have to
either put your transformers & [[cron]] jobs on the system yourself, or
make sure that the XML you want import already is in the Escenic
Syndication XML format.

** download-import-data
There's built-in support in *ece-import* for downloading files from
any FTP or HTTP server. Everything it needs to run this, is passed
from the command line:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ece-import \\
  --name myjob \\
  --publication mypub \\
  --user my-ftp-user \\
  --password my-ftp-password \\
  --uri http://news-feed.com/my-import-job-feed \\
  download-import-data
#+END_SRC

You can safely re-run this as many times as you wish, *ece-import*
will keep track of previously downloaded files and will not allow you
to run parallel processes to download date. If you ever need to
re-download third party data, you can remove the corresponding
resource from */var/lib/escenic/raw/mypub/myjob/download.state*

** Running an import job
This is the standard command/operation of *ece-import*, to take 3rd
party XML present in the raw spool, apply all transformations on it
and move the finished XML to the Escenic import spool.

When running it, you just need to pass the import job name and
publication name:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ ece-import \\
  --name myjob \\
  --publication mypub
#+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION
*ece-import* is the center piece of your infrastructure when
integrating and importing third party content with ECE. Here follows
is a quick run through of how it all fits together.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(1) ece-import create
      → new directories
      → new Nursery configuration files
      → instructions on how to add the new job to ECE
      → new cron jobs

(2) cron → ece-import download-import-data
      → /var/spool/escenic/raw/mypub/myjob/1.xml

(3) cron → ece-import →
      transformers/01-download-images-referenced-in-xml.sh →
      transformers/02-fix-image-colour-spaces.pl →
      transformers/03-tidy-up-xml.py →
      transformers/04-convert-to-escenic-xml.xsl
      → /var/spool/escenic/import/mypub/myjob/1.xml

(4) ECE/XMLImportSchedule → imports article into ECE
#+END_SRC

** (1)
Call *ece-import create* with or with an import archive to set up all
the necessary directories, Nursery configuration files, [[cron]] jobs
and so on for a new job.

** (2)
Cron calls *ece-import download-import-data* which downloads any new
XML (or other) file to */var/spool/escenic/raw/mypub/myjob*.

** (3)
Again, [[cron]] (this can be the same cron script, which runs after a
successful run of (2)) runs *ece-import*, this time without a
command. This task will iterate through all the transformers
inside */usr/share/escenic/import/mypub/myjob/transformers* and pass
the *1.xml* file to each of them.

Once this is done, *ece-import* checks if the resulting file is a well
formed XML file and that it looks like the Escenic syndication XML
format.

If it passes these tests, *ece-import* moves the *1.xml* to the spool
directory for the ECE Import service to notice it. The file is now
in */var/spool/escenic/import/mypub/myjob/1.xml*

** (4)
The standard ECE Import service detects that there is a new XML file
for it in the Escenic Syndication XML format and imports it into
ECE. Users should now see the fresh article in e.g. Escenic Content
Studio.

** Further reading
For further explanation of why *ece-import* was created and rationale
for how it was implemented, see the [[BACKGROUND]] section.

* Structure of an import archive
When creating a new import configuration for your project, the
following directory structure is required:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
<pub>/<import name>
<pub>/<import name>/transformers/<number>-<transformer task>.xsl
<pub>/<import name>/cron.hourly/<cron job command>
<pub>/<import name>/cron.every.five.minutes/<cron job command>
#+END_SRC

- publication name :: the name of the publication for which the import
     job(s) are defined. You can have more than one publication in
     each zip archive.
- import job name :: lowercase with hyphens between words (if more
     than one)
- transformers :: directory with files prefixed with *<number>-*,
                  indicating the order of transformation to apply to
                  your import job. If this is a xsl file, *ece-import*
                  will run *xsltproc* on the file, whereas .sh files
                  will be run in a bash wrapper.

                  Each of the transformers will be called with one
                  argument, namely the input XML data. Each
                  transformer is responsible to write changes back to
                  the file.
- cron.hourly :: commands to be run every our. These will be put
                 in */etc/cron.hourly* on the import server. Be sure
                 to set the execute bit on the file and note that as
                 with all cron jobs, the file cannot have a file
                 suffix.
- cron.every.five.minutes :: commands to run every five minutes.

Here, you see we have one publication called *mypub* with one import
job called *myjob* and a second publication with the name *otherpub*
which has the import job *otherjob*.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ unzip -t my-great-import-archive.zip.zip
mypub/myjob/transformers/01-fix-encoding.sh
mypub/myjob/transformers/02-convert-all-cows-to-ducks.xsl
mypub/myjob/transformers/02-convert-duck-to-escenic-xml.xsl
mypub/myjob/cron.hourly/get-files-from-myjob-ftp
mypub/myjob/cron.every.five.minutes/ask-for-public-ip
otherpub/otherjob/transformers/01-from-other-to-escenic-xml.xsl
#+END_SRC

As you can guess from the file names,
the *02-convert-all-cows-to-ducks.xsl* stylesheet will be first
applied to the incoming data (normally XML) and
the *02-convert-duck-to-escenic-xml.xsl* will be applied next before
the resulting Escenic XML will be imported into the Escenic Content
Engine.

* BACKGROUND
The motivation for creating *ece-import* was to tackle a number of
problems we have seen over and over again in countless projects
related to importing third party content into ECE.

** Easy to set up new import jobs
Integrating ECE with external systems to get the external data into
ECE has always been a challenging task. First off, it's the setting up
of an ECE import job, which demands several *.properties* files to be
written, put in the correct path on the file system, and added to the
correct *Initial.properties* to be bootstrapped.

Another problem we've seen over and over again, is that all the
relevant directories either were not present, had the wrong
permissions or the import directories were created under the wrong
paths. All of which made the ECE import fail.

Using ece-import [[create]], you don't have to worry about creating the
relevant Nursery components, create sufficient directory structure
with correct permissions or what the new stanza
in *Initial.properties* must look like to load your new import job
Nursery component.

** Easier to make error free import data
But this is just the start of problems so many projects have faced up
through the years. The transformation of the external data, say a feed
from a new agency or video meta data from a streaming video service,
is another challenge. To transform these external formats, often a
different XML format, which sadly very often neither validates, has
the correct file encoding or is not even well formed (!). The related
images are also often faulty, having the wrong colour space or has
file names containing non-printable characters, which again are
impossible, or difficult to refer to in an error free way from the XML
files.

All of the above make the ECE import fail.  Since such errors easily
drowns in the other ECE log errors and are time consuming to replay,
we wanted to move the complexity of the import job away from the ECE
XML import framework so that the Escenic import configuration could be
as simple as possible, only relating to the standard Escenic XML
syndication format.

By using *ece-import* it is really easy for you to write simple, small
BASH, Python or Perl scripts which can perform small "massaging" tasks
that you'd otherwise would have to do in a manual step prior to
feeding the external data to the ECE importer. For instance, to change
the encoding on the incoming XML files from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8, you
could write create a new transformer
called *01-convert-from-iso-8859-1-to-utf-8.sh* like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
#! /usr/bin/env bash
iconv --from-code "iso-8859-1" --to-code "utf-8" $1
#+END_SRC
and put it
in */usr/share/escenic/import/mypub/myjob/transformers*. Now, this
script would be called once for each new XML file.

Before, all of these "massaging scripts" were called manually on a
fresh batch of imports (or say migration data), before the data was
passed on to the ECE import job. Now, all of these scripts can be
incorporated into the main import process, having a clear structure,
order of execution, error handling and logging.

** Easy to debug transformations
In a standard ECE import job setup, you will have one or more import
filters which in turn run an XSL sheet. If something goes wrong with
one of them, most Escenic engineers and consultants (and probably
customer admins too), would test the transformation using a command
line tool such as *xsltproc*
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ xsltproc from-reuters-to-escenic.xsl some-reuters-article.xml
#+END_SRC

The reason that most people use this approach as this is far easier
than re-configuring the import job to use the ECE import job debug
filter, which involves editing *.properties* file(s), turning on debug
in the running app server log configuration and peeking in the correct
log file.

By using *ece-import*, everything is set up to be easy to retry
manually. The whole concept is that it should be easy to take just one
step and execute it from the command line. *ece-import* provides
extensive messages about everything it's doing
in */var/log/escenic/ece-import.log* and you should have no problems
checking each of the transformation steps by yourself by reading it.

** Easy to download data from FTP and HTTP sources
Downloading data from external sources via FTP or HTTP has been done
so many times, often with buggy shell code, leaving the scripts
running multiple times in paralell, re-downloading the same files
over and over again, or failing because the output of the directory index
listing has changed.

By using [[download-import-data][ece-import download-import-data]] you get tried and tested code
for doing this which addresses all of the above problems:
- Works with all web servers and all FTP servers
- Doesn't depend on the directory listing format, the locale of the
  web server or any other, non-standard pre-requisite.
- Keeps track of the state of previous runs/downloads for the
  different import jobs
- Ensures that only one instance of the download job is running at
  any given time.
- Runs on any Linux or UNIX system, using standard BASH and cron
  building blocks.

** No additional configuration
There are enough configuration files on a production system, so
the *ece-import* itself doesn't have any configuration files to add
to that burden. Everything it needs is read from the command line
options or from configuration files already present on the system.

* CREATING TRANSFORMERS
You can write a transformer in either XSL, Perl, Python or BASH. You
put it in *<pub>/<job>/transformers/<number>-<transformer task>.<{xsl,pl,py,sh}>*
and specify the order in which it should run by setting the <number>
before/after your other transformers (if any, many folks only have one
transformer which is an XSL file).

All transformers are run by the ece-import command and they get one
argument, namely the raw XML file from the 3rd party system. All
transformers work on the same XML file, so that changes done in
e.g. *01-first.sh* are passed on to *02-second.pl*. Each transformer
must read the file and write to the same file. That's the contract.

Here's an example of a transformer that downloads all the pictures
mentioned in the raw XML. ece-import will copy any multimedia files
to the ECE import spool for you, so the transformer only needs to
worry about downloading these to the directory of the incoming XML
file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#! /usr/bin/env bash

# Command which will download all thumbnails listed in the XML
# exported from VMEO.
#
# It is normally called from ece-import, but can also be called
# directly (when debugging).

xpath_to_get_thumbnail_urls"/didl:DIDL/didl:Item/didl:Component/didl:Decommandor/didl:Statement/mpeg7:Mpeg7/mpeg7:Decommandion/mpeg7:Summarization/mpeg7:Summary/mpeg7:VisualSummaryComponent/mpeg7:ImageLocator/mpeg7:MediaUri"

# $1 is the raw XML
cat "$1" | \\
  xml_grep --nowrap --cond $xpath_to_get_thumbnail_urls | \\
  sed 's/></>\n</g' | \\
  sed "s#.*>\(.*\)<.*#\1#g" | while read url; do
  wget \\
    --quiet \\
    --continue \\
    --output-document $(dirname $1)/$(basename $url) \\
    $url;
done
#+END_SRC

* FILES
- /usr/share/escenic/import/<pub>/<job> :: Directory holding
     the [[cron]] scripts and transformers of the import job. Normally,
     set up by the *ece-import* [[create]] command.

- /var/spool/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job> :: The *ece-import*
     [[download-import-data]] command will download files to this
     directory and when *ece-import* is invoked with the standard
     operation, it will look in here for new 3rd party XML files.

- /var/spool/escenic/import/<pub>/<job> :: Once *ece-import* has
     applied all the transformations on the 3rd party XML and it has
     been checked to be valid Escenic XML, the file is put in
     here. The ECE XML Import Service looks in this directory for new
     files to import.

- /var/cache/escenic/import/<pub>/<job>/<file> :: This is the work
     directory of *ece-import* where raw 3rd party XML files are put
     while being processed by the transformers.

- /var/backups/escenic/import/<pub>/<job>/succeeded/<file>.gz :: When
     3rd party XML has been successfully transformed, the original
     XML is compressed with [[gzip]] and put here.

- /var/backups/escenic/import/<pub>/<job>/failed/<file> :: When
     3rd party XML fails to be transformed, the original
     XML is moved here. It's not compressed to make it as easy as
     possible to retry it.

- /var/log/escenic/ece-import.log :: *ece-import* writes detailed
     transcripts of everything it does to this file making it easy
     for you to replay any of the steps.

- /var/run/escenic/ece-import-<command>.lock :: *ece-import* will
     create different lock files depending on the three
     commands/operations it supports. I.e. a long running download of
     3rd party data (*ece-import download-import-data*) will not stop a
     regular import to run (*ece-import*).

- /var/lib/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job>/download.state :: State file
     holding all the URLs (HTTP or FTP) that *ece-import* has
     downloaded before.

* TROUBLESHOOTING

To trigger a (re)import of an already imported file,
- edit the /var/lib/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job>/download.state file as the escenic user and remove the respective filenames 
or 
- use sed '/pattern to match/d' sed /var/lib/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job>/download.state > /var/lib/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job>/download.newstate
- verify that /var/lib/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job>/download.newstate is good
- mv /var/lib/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job>/download.newstate /var/lib/escenic/raw/<pub>/<job>/download.state

then wait a while for the import to happen again. or trigger it with the ece-import command.
