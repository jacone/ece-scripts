#+TITLE: User Guide for the generate-changelog Command
#+AUTHOR: Escenic Cloud Team
#+OPTIONS: H:6 num:5 toc:2

* Introduction
The =generate-changelog= command will help you with the following tasks:

- [[Getting an overview of all the JIRA issues]] that have been worked on
  in the list of commits.

- [[Getting a full code diff]] of all changes in the current build.

- [[Getting a risk assessment]] score for this build of the source code.

* Configuration
The =generate-changelog= command requires a configuration file in the
user's home directory: =.generate-changelog.conf=:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
jira_base_url=https://jira.mycompany.com
svn_base_url=${jira_base_url}/svn

# optional parameters, may be passed on the command line
project_code=my-jira-project
user=my-jira-user-name
password=my-jira-password
#+END_SRC

* Running generate-changelog
Go into the directory where you've got the trunk or branch of your
project checked out and issue =generate-changelog= with the =--from=
and optional =--to== parameters to specify which revision you want to
create a change log for:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd ~/src/my-project/branches/5.5
$ generate-changelog --from 2342
Full diff of all 7 changes:
/home/torstein/.generate-changelog/my-project/branches/5.5/from-2342-to-COMMITTED.diff
Report: /home/torstein/.generate-changelog/my-project/branches/5.5/from-2342-to-COMMITTED.report
#+END_SRC

If you don't specify =--to=, you will get the report up until the
latest committed change.

* Getting a risk assessment
[[Getting an overview of all the JIRA][The report]] also contains a risk assessment score. This score is
calculated on the number of lines in the code diff. This means the
number of lines changed + the diff context. Hence, a one line change
in a two line file will have a lower risk score than a one line
change in a 100 line big file.

The risk assessment score is just an indicator, it doesn't (as of
yet) have more logic than what's mentioned above, but in future, it
might have some logic that counts some code changes less (or more)
risky than others.

* Getting an overview of all the JIRA issues
Each run of =generate-changelog= will create a full code diff
available in:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
~/.generate-changelog/<project>/trunk/from-<from>-to-<to>.diff
#+END_SRC
For instance, if you run =generate-changelog= as this:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ generate-changelog --from 5401 --to 5856 --project toy
#+END_SRC

you will find an overview of all the JIRA issues that have been
mentioned in commit messages. The issue titles have been pulled from
JIRA, so is reporter information and some other bits and pieces.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
~/.generate-changelog/myproject/trunk/from-5401-to-5856.report
#+END_SRC

* Getting a full code diff
If you've run =generate-changelog= like what's described in [[Gettingan overview of all the JIRA][getting
the JIRA overview]], you will see your diff in:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
~/.generate-changelog/myproject/trunk/from-5401-to-5856.diff
#+END_SRC
