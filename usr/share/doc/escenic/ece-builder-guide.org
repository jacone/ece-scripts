* NAME
ece-builder

* SYNOPSIS
ece-builder [[[-i builder-conf-file]]] [[[-u user-conf-file]]] [[[-a artifact-path]]] [[[-l list-of-artifacts]]]  [[[-V]]]

* DESCRIPTION
The ece-builder is a command the creates Enterprise Archive file (ear)  and configuration packages(deb,rpm)
to install for Escenic Installation. This command creates an builder user in to the system,
under which the basic skeleton of the builder is generated. Then for each project or customer it
creates a separate user, under which ear and configuration packages for that project or customer is built.
It can also add an artifact or list of artifacts to be used by all the projects or customers.

** -i builder-conf-file
Creates builder user and setup builder skeleton under it.

** -u user-conf-file
Creates customer user to build an specific project.

** -a  artifact-path
Adds an artifact to the builder.

** -l list-of-artifacts
Adds a list of artifacts to the builder.

** -V
Shows the version of ece-builder

** Initialize the builder
To initialize the builder we need to run the following command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece-builder initialize
#+END_SRC
After running this command two configuration files builder.conf and user.conf will be
generated under /etc/escenic directory. The builder.conf file is needed to setup the builder
and user.conf file is used to setup customer project builder.

** Setting up builder
The first task for creating a builder is to setup the builder.
The ece-builder script require a builder.conf file to setup builder under a user called builder.
This configuration file is generated with the initialize command and look like following

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
technet_user=technet-user
technet_password=technet-pass
maven_vizrt_user=maven-user
maven_vizrt_password=maven-pass

#+END_SRC

Here we need to change the credentials for technet to valid one. Also for maven_user and maven_password need to be
changed to a valid one. Now running the following command will setup the builder.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece-builder -i /etc/escenic/builder.conf
#+END_SRC

** Setup up customer project builder

Once when we are done with setting up the builder. Now we can create customer project
builder by supplying a user.conf file, which is created when the ece-builder initialize command
was run under /etc/escenic/.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece-builder -i /etc/escenic/user.conf
#+END_SRC

Running the above command will create a system user and setup the environment to build customer project
under that user.
