* DESCRIPTION
Command which will let you manage your Escenic Content Engine, Escenic

everything from starting & stopping the instance to building &
deploying EAR files and detailed information about the running
instances.

* OPTIONS
** -t --type type
The following types are available:
- engine: The Escenic Content Engine, this is the default and is the assumed type if none is specified.
- search: A standalone search indexer and solr instance
- rmi-hub: The RMI hub responsible for the internal communication between the ECE instances.
- analysis: The Escenic Analysis Engine also knows as 'Stats'

** -i --instance instance
The type instance, such as editor1, engine1 or search1
** -p --publication publication
Needed only for updating publication resources
** -r --resource resource
Used for updating publication resources.  Must be one of:
content-type, feature, layout, layout-group image-version, menu
** -v --verbose

You can specify one or more commands. The commands are executed in
the same order that you pass them to the ece command.
** applog
The type's app server log
** assemble
Runs the Assembly Tool.
** backup
Allows you to create backup of your entire Escenic installation, or
just specific parts of it. Without any additional options, ece
backup, will create a backup with:
- Solar & Nursery configuration (everything in /etc/escenic)
- DB dump
- Solar index
- Multimedia files
- The entire app server
- init.d script and its configuration

/var/cache/escenic/engine.ear.

Optionally, you can specify an EAR on a remote server by passing the
--uri parameter. If the server is password protected, you can either
set builder_http_user and  builder_http_password in ece.conf or pass
it on the command line:

| Deploy specific option | Explanation                        |

* TAB completion
The ece command offers TAB completion, given that your version of BASH
supports this and that you have enabled it (some distributions hasn't
turned on BASH completion per default).

You can auto complete all options and commands, as well as the
instance names, publication names and resources types.

* Log files
There are a number of log files associated with the different
instances. To get an overview of all the log files for a particular
instance, do:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece -i engine1 list-logs
#+END_SRC

To tail all of these, pass the -q parameter and pipe it to tail:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece -i engine1 -q list-logs | xargs tail -f
#+END_SRC

* Configuration files
| Path                             | Explanation                 |
|----------------------------------+-----------------------------|
| /etc/escenic/ece.conf            | The main configuration file |
| /etc/escenic/ece-<instance>.conf | Instance specific settings  |
| $HOME/.ecerc                     | User specific settings.     |

* Examples
Starting an instance:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece -i engine1 start
#+END_SRC

Creating a thread dump from an instance:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

deploy this new EAR and restart the instance:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece -i engine1 assemble deploy restart
#+END_SRC

Stop the instance, deploy an EAR from the build server, clean all app
server temporary files including the JSP compilation directory and
start the instance again:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ece -i engine1 \\
      --uri http://builder.example.com/myproject-1.2.ear \\
      stop clean deploy start
