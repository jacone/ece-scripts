# The directory where the import directories will be created. The migration
# setup service creates directories in the following structure:
#
# ${migrationDirectory}
# |-- publicationA (The "import" directory of this import configuration)
#    |-- archive (The "archive" directory for this import configuration)
#    |-- error (The "error" directory for this import configuration)
# |-- publicationB
#    |-- archive
#    |-- error
# ...(These directories are created for each publication)
#
# The directory structure is created when the application server starts. If
# you create a publication, then you can use the doStartService/doStopService
# method to recreate the import configurations for all publications again.

# The import reporter that will be used for all of the import configurations.
