# NOTES:
# This runs before the Tidy cleaner. So, we convert all ECE tags to valid XHTML tags and then PostTidyRegExFieldCleaner
# would convert them back to ECE tags again.
# Tidy does not create the short element syntax (e.g. <span/>). So, it is recommended to use "<span></span>" instead.
# Tidy converts all attributes to lower case at the moment. Please keep that in mind while adding expressions here.
#
# To search for "<custom>" and replace it with "<span>", you can use the following properties:
#
#      searchExpression.100=<custom>
#      replaceExpression.100=<span>
#
# Please note that, the index (i.e. 100) is important. The search/replace tokens are paired based on this index number.
# It is recommended to use indices starting from 100 since indices smaller than that are used by the system internally.

# Replace all "field" with a span
#searchExpression.002   = <field(.*?)(/>|>(.*?)</field>)
#replaceExpression.002  = <span x\\-escenic\\-type="field"$1>$3</span>

#searchExpression.003   = <relation(.*?)(/>|>(.*?)</relation>)
#replaceExpression.003  = <span x\\-escenic\\-type="relation"$1>$3</span>


# Replace all "preform" and "mel" tags with <span class="com.escenic.preform"> and <span class="com.escenic.mel">. 
# This can be used for other custom tags as well.
#
#searchExpression.100   = <(preform|mel)(.*?)(/>|>(.*?)</\\1>)
#replaceExpression.100  = <span class="com.escenic.$1"$2>$4</span>
