- Cache server profile

### ✔ YAML configuration file format

See the [unit tests](usr/local/src/unit-tests/ece-install-conf-file-reader-test.sh) for
configuration examples.

###  ✔ Remove the interactive mode. 

It's rarely used and complicates the source code and configuration
options unnecessarily.

## /usr/bin/ece

- Easier to extend, e.g. put `create-publication.sh` in a directory,
  e.g.`ece.d`, and get `ece create-publication`. The
  `create-publication` sub command is then included in TAB completion,
  help screens and `man` pages.
  

## Version 4.x
###  Easier to extend `ece-install`

Preferably in any language. Put a file in a directory and
`ece-install` will execute that file at a predictable point in time.
